### Performance Optimization Checklist

**Memory Optimization:**
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for frequent allocations
- [ ] Use streaming for large datasets
- [ ] Optimize memory access patterns for coalescing
- [ ] Monitor memory pressure and implement cleanup

**Kernel Optimization:**
- [ ] Optimize block sizes for target hardware
- [ ] Minimize register usage
- [ ] Use shared memory effectively
- [ ] Implement adaptive algorithm selection

**System Optimization:**
- [ ] Configure appropriate garbage collection settings
- [ ] Implement resource pooling
- [ ] Use asynchronous operations where possible
- [ ] Monitor and optimize thread pool usage

### Troubleshooting Quick Reference

**Out of Memory Issues:**
```csharp
// Immediate actions
GC.Collect(2, GCCollectionMode.Forced, true);
await memoryManager.ClearCachesAsync();
await memoryManager.DefragmentAsync();

// Long-term solutions
- Reduce batch sizes
- Enable memory pooling
- Use streaming for large datasets
- Monitor for memory leaks
```

**Performance Issues:**
```csharp
// Analysis steps
var analysis = await performanceTroubleshooter.AnalyzePerformanceAsync(
    operationName, actualDuration, dataSize, acceleratorType);

// Common optimizations
- Optimize memory access patterns
- Improve occupancy
- Use appropriate data types
- Consider algorithm alternatives
```

**Compilation Failures:**
```csharp
// Debug approach
using var debugContext = ILGPUDebugConfiguration.CreateDebugContext();
using var cpuAccelerator = debugContext.CreateCPUAccelerator(0);

// Test kernel on CPU for detailed error information
```
